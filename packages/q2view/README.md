# q2view

This HTML 5 interface provides a way to view `.qza`/`.qzv` files produced by
QIIME 2. It provides:

- Inspection of basic metadata
- Viewing of complex web-based visualizations
- Inspection of provenance

This interface uses the [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)
to "hoist" the contents of a `.qzv`'s `/data` directory into the interface
allowing relative links within a visualization to work via standard HTTP
requests.

To host the app locally, first install the dependencies (while in root of the repo):

```
npm install
```

Then run:

```
npm run dev
```

This will host the app on localhost:5173 by default
**Important:** HTTPS is required (by service worker API) when not hosting
from `localhost`.

**NOTE**: The locally hosted version of the app will most likely not work on Firefox due to the way Firefox interacts with the afformentioned Service Worker API.
